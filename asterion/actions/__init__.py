"""Admin action descriptors and the canonical BulkDeleteAction.

Subclass :class:`AdminAction` and add the instance to ``ModelAdmin.actions``
to expose a custom action at ``POST /api/v1/admin/{resource}/_actions/{action_name}``.

Actions must use ``session.flush()`` to materialize changes. The request
session's transaction is committed by ``get_async_session`` after the action
returns successfully, so calling ``commit()`` inside an action would
short-circuit the request's transaction lifecycle.

Two dispatch styles coexist:

* **Legacy** — override :meth:`AdminAction.execute(records, session, user)`.
  Existing actions in the wild keep working unchanged.
* **Typed (C3)** — set ``input_schema = MyPydanticModel`` and override
  :meth:`AdminAction.run(objects, data, ctx)`. The router validates the
  request body's ``data`` field through the pydantic model before
  dispatch. The router prefers ``run`` when the subclass has overridden
  it; otherwise it falls back to ``execute``.

    Subclasses set ``name``, ``label`` and implement either
    :meth:`execute` (legacy signature) or :meth:`run` (typed C3
    signature). The router picks whichever the subclass overrides.

    ``confirm`` — UI hint that the action should prompt before firing.
    Pure metadata; the framework does not enforce it.

    ``bulk`` — distinguishes bulk-style actions (one button operating
    on multiple selected rows) from single-record actions. Pure
    metadata for now; future row-level actions will toggle it.

    ``input_schema`` — pydantic model class describing the action's
    extra inputs. When set, the request body must include a ``data``
    object that validates against this model; ``run`` then receives
    the validated pydantic instance via the ``data`` argument.

    ``icon`` — optional UI hint naming the glyph the admin should render
    for this action (e.g. ``"pencil"``, ``"clock"``). Pure metadata; the
    framework does not interpret it. ``None`` lets the UI fall back to a
    generic action icon. Most relevant for ``bulk=False`` actions, which
    the list view renders as per-row icon buttons.
